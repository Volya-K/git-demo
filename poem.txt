Where's the revolution

You've been kept down
You've been pushed 'round
You've been lied to
You've been fed truths
Who's making your decisions?
You or your religion
Your government, your countries
You patriotic junkies

Where's the revolution?
Come on, people
You're letting me down
Where's the revolution?
Come on, people
You're letting me down
